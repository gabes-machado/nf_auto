In brief words **NF_AUTO** is an automation script to search and collect fiscal receipts from the **Agenci@Net** website, and download them to your machine.
In brazilian Accounting to collect fiscal receipts is a **burden**, and very often clients won't send them to their accountants, then they have to manually go the local treasury website to collect them. With this problem in mind, I developed an automation script that reads a data base in **.xlsx** (Excel File), go on to the local treasury website, scrapes and download all fiscal receipts.
